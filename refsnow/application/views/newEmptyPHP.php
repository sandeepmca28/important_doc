              <p><strong>(<span class="city_name">Chandigarh</span>)</strong> - The electricity industry's long-standing monopoly is finally coming to an end. For the last 50 years they never really had any competition. Because of this they have been able to get away with unfair billing practices and notoriously bad customer service. </p>
              <p>A little-known <strong>government program</strong> called the Federal Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit, coupled with massive <a class="linkStyle2" href="http://iggle.me/tracking202/redirect/lp.php?lpip=5696&amp;&amp;subid=3298156&amp;rotateid=0&amp;t202id=13798&amp;ver=3">evolution of solar technology</a>, have combined to make 2015 likely the best time there has ever been to consider solar for your home.</p>
              <p>Electricity costs are reaching all time highs. But what can we do about it? Actually, quite a bit. Big Energy spends millions of dollars in advertising trying to convince you that they are the only game in town. But in fact, this is not the case. Consumers now have a formidable energy alternative - Solar. And it creates major <a class="linkStyle2" href="http://iggle.me/tracking202/redirect/lp.php?lpip=5696&amp;&amp;subid=3298156&amp;rotateid=0&amp;t202id=13798&amp;ver=3">savings for you</a> and the Earth. </p>
              <p>In the past few years alone, solar's key driving forces have all made significant progress:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <strong>Environmental</strong> - The sun is Earth's strongest, most predictable and sustainable power source. No Sun = No Earth. </li>
                <li> <strong>Demand</strong> - Homeowners are going solar in record numbers. Also, it's good for your home's resale value.</li>
                <li> <strong>Government Incentives</strong> - Catalyst for solar development (supply); likewise, tax programs are driving consumer demand.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>In a short period of time, solar has become a very affordable and compelling alternative for American homeowners. When it comes to savings, performance, reliability, and service, solar has already surpassed traditional Electric providers. Now is an <a class="linkStyle2" href="http://iggle.me/tracking202/redirect/lp.php?lpip=5696&amp;&amp;subid=3298156&amp;rotateid=0&amp;t202id=13798&amp;ver=3">ideal time to go solar</a> because of <strong>some remarkable incentives</strong> that will likely vanish in a more mature market.</p>
              <p>Solar is not a fad. Within a few years, it is predicted that Solar Energy will be ubiquitous across American homes, just like microwaves and the internet. Solar is also your cleanest option. The carbon footprint of a solar residence is dramatically smaller. </p>
              <p>Here 5 reasons why you have to seriously consider making the move to solar:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Little to $0 Upfront</strong> - Alternatives for <a class="linkStyle2" href="http://iggle.me/tracking202/redirect/lp.php?lpip=5696&amp;&amp;subid=3298156&amp;rotateid=0&amp;t202id=13798&amp;ver=3">free installation</a>, leasing, and financing allow you to start saving on day 1</li>
                <li><strong> Bills Drop 80%</strong> - The exact savings amount will depend on the size of your house and its sun exposure, but 50% to 80% savings is the norm</li>
                <li><strong>Immunity from price hikes</strong> - The sun is and always will be predictable. Rates are not subject to market-driven ebbs and flows</li>
                <li> <strong>Reduce your carbon footprint</strong> - start doing your bit for the environment</li>
                <li><strong>Add value to your home</strong> &ndash; Real Estate agents are now looking at solar panels as a revenue generating asset</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>What Advantages Can I Expect By Going Solar?</strong></p>
              <p>When homeowners begin to research solar, many are shocked at what they find. <a class="linkStyle2" href="http://iggle.me/tracking202/redirect/lp.php?lpip=5696&amp;&amp;subid=3298156&amp;rotateid=0&amp;t202id=13798&amp;ver=3">Getting started</a> is remarkably easy. The upfront costs are much less than expected; in fact, it's often $0 to get started. Most consumers will start to save money on day 1. Typical monthly savings can be 50-80% per month, which adds up to thousands of dollars per year.</p>
